# Vulnerable Flask App
- Created to support my presentation for an English course at university on the topic of security audit demonstrations.
- Includes very basic vulnerabilities, as the presentation was also intended for a non-technical audience.
  - Examples of developer mistakes, such as leaving credentials in the source code
  - Use of plaintext cookies
